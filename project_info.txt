It contains 50 columns and a single target (y) to predict. We are asking for two models 
and a text description (no more than one page) comparing the two models to one another, 
discussing which one of the two you would suggest we use and why.

Use the attached "test" and "train" csv files: the train.csv file to develop and validate 
your models and then the test.csv to create two submissions (one from each model) that we 
will score. The submissions should be a single new line delimited file with your predictions.
